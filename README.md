# Text Summarization using NLP

Nowadays online information services are growing and data which is available in world wide web is increasing rapidly. This results in overload of well-organized data and there no time to read everything which is available. Thus, we planned to study/investigate text summarization with Natural Language Processing. The basic idea is to input unorganized enormous amount of data like articles or documents or captions in text format and getting summary for the data which we have passed. With text summarization, we must get coherent and brief throughout of the data which we pass. Extraction and Abstraction are the two broad categories in text summarization. In this process we going to study approaches to text summarization.

Overview of the process
1. Collection of data
As the initial step, user needs to provide with the link or document or text to start summarization.
2. Pre-processing
We will be passing the document, text, website link or YouTube video link and generating the sentences.
3. Constructing a graph/tokenization
During this phase, we consider each sentence as a node including its properties with behaviour and meaning to the context.
4. Sentence ranking Algorithm
We will be identifying the frequency of the keywords, check relevancy of sentences with the document title.
5. Summarization
Final output of the application is the summarized text or captions.
